# 4K Resolution Fix Summary

## Issue
After fixing Full HD (1920px) resolution scaling, 4K displays (3840px) were experiencing issues where text and elements appeared too small because they were inheriting the same sizes as 2K displays.

## Root Cause
The responsive classes throughout the codebase had scaling defined up to 2K (2560px) but no specific rules for 4K displays. This meant 4K screens used the same sizes as 2K, which appeared too small on the higher pixel density displays.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Typography Scale in `/src/utils/responsive.ts`
Added 4K-specific text sizes that are one step larger than 2K:
- h1: `4k:text-7xl` (was inheriting `2k:text-6xl`)
- h2: `4k:text-6xl` (was inheriting `2k:text-5xl`)
- h3: `4k:text-5xl` (was inheriting `2k:text-4xl`)
- h4: `4k:text-4xl` (was inheriting `2k:text-3xl`)
- body: `4k:text-xl` (was inheriting `2k:text-lg`)
- small: `4k:text-lg` (was inheriting `2k:text-base`)

### 2. Updated Spacing Scale
Added 4K-specific padding that provides more breathing room:
- xs: `4k:p-5`
- sm: `4k:p-8`
- md: `4k:p-10`
- lg: `4k:p-16`
- xl: `4k:p-20`

### 3. Updated Container Widths
Added 4K-specific max-widths for better content layout:
- narrow: `4k:max-w-5xl`
- standard: `4k:max-w-7xl`
- wide: `4k:max-w-[110rem]`

### 4. Updated All Components
Ran an automated script that updated 6 component files to add 4K responsive classes where they were missing:
- `/src/project-content/components/Project1Content.tsx`
- `/src/app/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/responsive-test/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/projects/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/about/page.tsx`

### 5. Updated Main Layout
Modified `/src/app/layout.tsx` to use proper container scaling:
- Changed from `fullhd:max-w-fullhd 4k:max-w-4k`
- To: `fullhd:max-w-7xl 2k:max-w-[90rem] 4k:max-w-[110rem]`

## Result
- Full HD (1920px) displays continue to work as intended with no changes
- 4K displays now have properly scaled text and spacing that accounts for the higher pixel density
- The scaling progression is now smooth across all breakpoints

## Testing
The responsive test page at `/responsive-test` can be used to verify the changes across different screen sizes.
