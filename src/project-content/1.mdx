## Project Overview: QGIS Plugin - [Plugin Name]

This project involved the development of a custom plugin for QGIS (Quantum GIS), an open-source Geographic Information System. The primary goal of this plugin is to [State the main purpose of the plugin - e.g., automate spatial data processing for water resource management, simplify the creation of specific map layouts, analyze demographic data within user-defined areas, etc.].

It addresses the need for [Describe the problem or inefficiency this plugin solves] which is often encountered by [Mention the target users - e.g., GIS analysts, environmental scientists, urban planners]. By providing an intuitive user interface and automating complex steps, the plugin aims to save users significant time and reduce potential errors.


## Core Features

The plugin offers several key functionalities:

* **[Feature 1]:** [Briefly describe the first main feature - e.g., Batch processing of raster layers based on user-defined parameters].
* **[Feature 2]:** [Briefly describe the second main feature - e.g., Interactive selection of vector features for analysis].
* **[Feature 3]:** [Briefly describe the third main feature - e.g., Generation of standardized report maps with custom legends].
* **[Feature 4, if any]:** [e.g., Input data validation and error handling].
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Developed using PyQt to integrate seamlessly with the QGIS environment.

## Technology Stack

This plugin was primarily developed using:

* **QGIS:** Leveraging the QGIS Desktop environment and its plugin architecture.
* **Python:** The core programming language for the plugin logic and QGIS API interaction.
* **PyQGIS (QGIS Python API):** Used extensively to interact with QGIS layers (vector, raster), map canvas, processing algorithms, and project management.
* **PyQt (specifically Qt bindings like PyQt5/PyQt6):** Used for creating the graphical user interface (dialogs, buttons, input fields) integrated within QGIS.
* **[Other Python Libraries]:** Mention any other significant libraries used (e.g., `pandas`, `geopandas`, `numpy`, `requests` if fetching external data).
* **[Development Tools]:** e.g., VS Code, Qt Designer (if used), Git/GitHub.

## How it Works: Technical Details

The plugin follows a workflow where the user [Describe the general steps the user takes - e.g., selects input layers, defines parameters in the dialog, clicks 'Run'].

Behind the scenes, the Python code interacts with the PyQGIS API to:
1.  **Access Data:** Load and validate the input vector/raster layers selected by the user (`iface.activeLayer()`, `QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName(...)`).
2.  **Process Parameters:** Retrieve values entered by the user in the PyQt dialog.
3.  **Execute Core Logic:** Perform the main task, for example, iterating through features, running QGIS processing algorithms (`processing.run(...)`), or performing custom calculations.

```python
# Example relevant Python snippet (using PyQGIS)
# Replace with an actual interesting part of YOUR code

from qgis.core import QgsVectorLayer, QgsProject, QgsFeatureIterator

def process_selected_features(layer_name):
    layers = QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName(layer_name)
    if not layers:
        print(f"Layer '{layer_name}' not found.") # Removed the '!'
        return

    layer = layers[0]
    if not isinstance(layer, QgsVectorLayer):
        print("Layer is not a vector layer.")
        return

    selected_features = layer.selectedFeatures()
    count = 0
    for feature in selected_features:
        # Process each selected feature
        geom = feature.geometry()
        attribute_value = feature['attribute_name'] # Access attribute
        print(f"Processing feature {feature.id()} with value: {attribute_value}")
        # Add your processing logic here...
        count += 1

    print(f"Processed {count} selected features.")

# Example usage (within the plugin's run method)
# process_selected_features('My Target Layer')
